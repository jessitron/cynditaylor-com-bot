# High-Level Architecture Discussion

## User Prompt
```
We're going to implement this in small steps. Will it help you to make a high-level implementation of the whole program before we make any piece of it work?
Or is it easier to start with only the piece that works and add structure later?
```

## Assistant Response
I suggested starting with a high-level implementation plan first to understand how different parts of the system will interact, identify core components, implement pieces incrementally, and make better decisions about interfaces.

## User Prompt
```
Go for it.
Here's what I know so far:
- it will receive an API call with instructions and attachments. (Zapier or similar will handle email/text integration, outside of this repo)
- it will record everything it does using OpenTelemetry, so I can see what's happening in Honeycomb
- it will have a loop to interact with the Anthropic API, and tools that let it work with the code
- at the beginning of each operation, it will fetch from github. At the end it will push to github
- Someday, it will have a loop to watch for changes and a way to reply to the email/text. That is not something we will do today
```

## Assistant Actions
1. Examined the current repository structure
2. Looked for information about the cynditaylor.com website repository
3. Checked existing dependencies in package.json
4. Created a detailed high-level architecture plan with the following components:
   - API Server
   - Agent Orchestrator
   - GitHub Integration
   - AI Interaction Module
   - Website Modification Engine
   - Telemetry System
   - Notification System (future)
5. Outlined data flow and implementation phases

## User Feedback
```
this is too complicated to start with. Let's start over. I'm gonna start a new chat
```

## Conclusion
The user preferred a simpler approach to start with, focusing on building working pieces first and adding structure incrementally rather than beginning with a comprehensive architecture.
