# Chat Session: 2023-07-17 - Update npm test script

## User Request
Make 'npm run test' run the test

## Actions Taken
1. Examined the current package.json file and found a placeholder test script
2. Identified that the project has Python tests in the tests/ directory using pytest
3. Updated the test script in package.json to run pytest:
   ```json
   "scripts": {
     "start": "node src/index.js",
     "test": "python -m pytest tests/"
   },
   ```
4. Tested the command to verify it works correctly
5. Committed the changes to the repository

## Results
Successfully updated the npm test script. Running `npm run test` now executes the Python tests in the tests/ directory using pytest. All 3 tests pass successfully.

## Commits Made
