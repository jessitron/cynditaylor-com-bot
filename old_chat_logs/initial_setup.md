# Initial Setup Chat - Project Creation

## User Prompt

```
Let's start by describing the purpose of this project.
We are going to create an agent that can improve the website cynditaylor.com
Here's the workflow, draw a mermaid diagram in the README for it.
- Cyndi Taylor looks at her website and wants something to be different. Maybe she wants a different color, maybe update the title of an image, maybe add an image of a new painting.
- She sends an email or a text with instructions and any attachment.
- That gets to an agent (this agent, which we coding in this project). The agent has the code for the website checked out from GitHub
- The agent changes the code for the website and pushed to GitHub
- GitHub Actions builds the website and publishes it (it's on GitHub Pages)
- the agent notices that it's up and sends mom a reply, telling her it's ready for her to look at
- Mom says it's good or supplies further instructions. All her feedback is recorded.
```
