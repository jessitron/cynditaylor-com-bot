# Chat Session: Main Function Implementation

## User Request
Create a main function that calls the agent with hard-coded instructions, which will then call Anthropic and execute tools until the instructions are fulfilled.

## Actions Taken
1. Installed the Anthropic Python SDK: `pip install anthropic`
2. Created a real implementation of the Anthropic API adapter in `src/agent/real_anthropic_adapter.py`
3. Enhanced the `execute_tool` function in `src/agent/agent.py` to handle more realistic tools:
   - `read_file`: Read content from a file
   - `write_file`: Write content to a file
   - `list_files`: List all files in a directory recursively
   - `git_pull`: Pull the latest changes from the remote repository
   - `git_push`: Commit and push changes to the remote repository
4. Updated the tools list in the Agent class to include all the new tools
5. Created a main.py file with a main function that:
   - Sets up the environment by loading environment variables
   - Initializes the Anthropic adapter and agent
   - Runs the agent with hard-coded instructions
   - Processes and displays the results
6. Installed python-dotenv for loading environment variables: `pip install python-dotenv`
7. Created a .env.example file with placeholders for required environment variables

## Implementation Details
1. **Real Anthropic Adapter**: Implemented a concrete class that makes actual API calls to Anthropic using the official SDK.
2. **Enhanced Tools**: Added several useful tools for file operations and Git operations.
3. **Main Function**: Created a main entry point that initializes the agent and runs it with hard-coded instructions.
4. **Environment Setup**: Added support for loading environment variables from a .env file.

## Next Steps
1. Create a real .env file with your Anthropic API key
2. Run the main.py script to test the agent
3. Implement more tools as needed
4. Add OpenTelemetry instrumentation for better monitoring
5. Enhance error handling and logging
