# Chat Session: 2023-07-16 - Remove Obvious Comments

## User Request
Remove all obvious comments that clutter up the code.

## Actions Taken
1. Identified files with obvious comments:
   - Python package `__init__.py` files
   - Python class files with redundant docstrings
   - JavaScript files with obvious comments
   - Configuration files with commented-out options

2. Removed the following types of comments:
   - Comments that just state a file makes a directory a Python package
   - Method docstrings that just restate the method name (e.g., "Initialize the adapter")
   - Commented-out configuration options in devcontainer.json
   - Detailed TODO lists that just enumerate steps without adding value

3. Files modified:
   - `src/__init__.py`
   - `src/agent/__init__.py`
   - `tests/__init__.py`
   - `src/agent/anthropic_adapter.py`
   - `src/agent/agent.py`
   - `src/agent/fake_anthropic_adapter.py`
   - `src/index.js`
   - `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json`

## Results
Successfully removed obvious comments from the codebase, making it cleaner and more maintainable.
