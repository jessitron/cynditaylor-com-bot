# Agent Loop Implementation Chat

## User Prompt
```
To start with, let's make the main agentic loop. Make a test that has hard-coded instructions input, and a module that loops through LLM calls and tool executions. 
Do not run the test yet
```

## Request Summary
The user requested to create the main agentic loop for the Cyndi Taylor Website Bot, including a test with hard-coded instructions and a module that handles LLM calls and tool executions. The test should not be run yet.

## Assistant Actions
1. Analyzed the current repository structure to understand the project
2. Created a Python project structure for the agent implementation
3. Implemented the following components:
   - `requirements.txt` with necessary dependencies
   - `src/agent/agent.py` with the main agent loop implementation
   - `src/agent/tools.py` with tools for the agent to use
   - `src/agent/llm.py` for Anthropic API integration
   - `src/agent/telemetry.py` for OpenTelemetry integration with Honeycomb
   - `src/main.py` as the main entry point
   - `tests/test_agent_loop.py` with a test using hard-coded instructions
   - Configuration files: `pytest.ini`, `.env.example`
   - Updated `.gitignore` to include Python-specific entries
   - Added documentation in `src/README.md`

## Implementation Details
1. **Agent Loop**: Implemented a class that handles the main loop of receiving instructions, making LLM calls, parsing tool calls, and executing tools.
2. **Tools**: Created tools for git operations and file manipulation.
3. **LLM Integration**: Set up Anthropic API client with a system prompt.
4. **Telemetry**: Implemented OpenTelemetry integration for logging to Honeycomb.
5. **Testing**: Created a test with hard-coded instructions and mock LLM responses.

## Next Steps
1. Run the test to verify the agent loop functionality
2. Implement more tools as needed
3. Enhance the LLM prompt to better handle website modification tasks
4. Add more comprehensive error handling and logging
