# Update Mermaid Diagram Chat

## User Prompt
```
I would like the mermaid diagram to show a sequence of steps, starting with my mom (Cyndi Taylor) asking for an improvement and ending with her seeing the result and being happy 
```

## Request Summary
The user requested to update the mermaid diagram in the README to show a sequence of steps instead of a flow chart, with a clear beginning (Cyndi Taylor requesting a change) and end (Cyndi being happy with the result).

## Assistant Actions
1. Retrieved the current README.md file
2. Updated the mermaid diagram from a flow chart (graph TD) to a sequence diagram (sequenceDiagram)
3. Added participants: Cyndi Taylor, Website Bot Agent, GitHub Repository, GitHub Actions, and cynditaylor.com
4. Created a step-by-step sequence showing:
   - Cyndi sending a request
   - The agent making changes
   - GitHub building and deploying
   - The agent notifying Cyndi
   - Cyndi viewing and providing feedback
5. Added an "alt" section showing two possible outcomes:
   - Cyndi is happy with the changes (ending with a happy emoji)
   - Cyndi requests further adjustments (process repeats)
6. Committed the changes to the repository

## Next Steps
The README now has a clearer sequence diagram showing the step-by-step workflow from request to satisfaction. Next steps could include implementing the actual agent functionality.
