# Active work for Augment Agent right now

We are working on some refactoring.

Frank now accepts a list of exchanges and replays them. If the prompt doesn't match, it is only a warning.
It always returns the next response in the list.

✅ Completed refactoring to add proper types:

[x] Make a type for the exchanges.
[x] Make a type for the conversation.
[x] Make the ConversationLogger use that type
[x] Make the ConversationReader return a Conversation type
[x] Make the Frank LLM use the Exchange type
[x] Make Frank return a response string
[x] Change the test to provide a proper list of Exchanges

All tasks have been completed and tests are passing. The code now has proper type definitions for Exchange and Conversation objects, making it more maintainable and type-safe.

## Next

I want to change how tool call results are recorded.

In a Conversation, the first exchange should have this structure:

```json
{
    "id": "exchange-1",
    "prompt": {
        "text": "The exact prompt text sent to the LLM",
        "metadata": {
            ... whatever...
        }
    },
    "response": {
        "text": "The full response from the LLM to replay",
        "tool_calls": [
            {
                "tool_name": "example_tool",
                "parameters": {"param1": "value1"},
                // never a result here
            }
        ]
    }
}
```

Then subsequent exchanges, after tool calls, should have this structure:

```json
{
    "id": "exchange-2",
    "prompt": {
        "tool_calls": [
            {
                "tool_name": "example_tool",
                "parameters": {"param1": "value1"},
                "result": "Tool execution result"
            }
        ],
        "new_text": "only the text that was not in the previous prompt",
        "prompt_text": "the whole prompt to send this time",
        "metadata": {
            ... whatever...
        }
    },
    "response": {
        "response_text": "Follow-up response from the LLM... maybe it doesn't have tool calls this time"
    }
}
```

[x] change the structure of the Conversation types
[x] make the agent send a prompt in this structure
[x] make the test conversation follow this structure
[x] make Frank return a response object including tool calls, as in the replay
[x] the Agent no longer tries to log tool call results; instead it includes them in the Prompt structure
[x] that way the ConversationLogger can just log the tool call results with the prompt, instead of trying to cram them into the previous exchange.

All tasks have been completed. The code now follows the new structure for recording tool call results in the prompt structure rather than trying to add them to the previous exchange's response. This makes the conversation flow more natural and easier to follow.

## Corrections

✅ Completed corrections to use proper dataclass objects:

[x] Rename `text` to `prompt_text` in the `Prompt` class
[x] Rename `text` to `response_text` in the `Response` class
[x] Update the `to_dict` and `from_dict` methods to use the new field names
[x] Change the `get_response_for_prompt` method to accept a `Prompt` object and return a `Response` object
[x] Update the Frank LLM implementation to accept a `Prompt` object and return a `Response` object
[x] Update the LoggingConversationPartner to handle `Prompt` and `Response` objects
[x] Update the Agent implementation to create and use `Prompt` and `Response` objects
[x] Update the test conversation file to use the new field names

All corrections have been completed. The code now uses proper dataclass objects for Prompt and Response throughout the codebase, rather than passing around strings. This makes the code more type-safe and easier to maintain.

## Corrections

✅ Completed additional corrections:

[x] The log_exchange method in ConversationLogger should take 2 objects, not a whole slew of primitives.
[x] The Agent should never extract tool calls. Tool calls come in the Response object from the ConversationPartner.

All additional corrections have been completed. The code now follows a more object-oriented approach:
1. The ConversationLogger.log_exchange method now takes Prompt and Response objects directly
2. The Agent no longer extracts tool calls from the response text, but instead uses the tool_calls field in the Response object
3. The LoggingConversationPartner has been updated to pass Prompt and Response objects directly to the ConversationLogger
4. Tests have been updated to work with the new Prompt and Response objects and are passing
5. The test_conversation.json file has been updated to use the new field names (prompt_text, response_text, new_text) and structure
6. Added a final exchange with no tool calls to the test_conversation.json file to properly end the conversation
