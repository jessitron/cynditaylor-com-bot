# Get the tools to work in a specific directory

In agent.py, line 75, it says  # For file operations, adjust paths to be relative to website_dir

OMG this does not belong in the agent. Remove this section.

Instead, make the file_read and file_write and file_list tools work in that website_dir only. All their operations are relative to that directory.

## Plan

1. Remove the path adjustment logic from agent.py lines 75-81 and 90-104
2. Modify file tools to accept a `base_directory` parameter in their constructor
3. Update ListFilesTool, ReadFileTool, and WriteFileTool to work relative to base_directory
4. Update agent.py to pass website_dir to file tools during initialization
5. Ensure all file operations are automatically scoped to the website directory

This will move the directory scoping responsibility from the agent to the tools themselves, making the code cleaner and more logical.
