# Create some real tests

We are going to work in small increments.
The end goal here is: property-based tests that express how the agent works, that print great summaries of what is happening when they fail.

## Make the agent more testable.

We are not implementing property-based tests yet. We are implementing only one test.

[x] The agent should accept an LLM provider in the constructor
[] Implement an in-memory version of the conversation logger
[] Implement an in-memory version of the conversation reader, which accepts a conversation as an a constructor argument
[] use these in a test with a hard-coded conversation, checking that the logged conversation matches the one passed in.

### Detailed plan:

#### Step 1: Single Test Implementation ‚Üê do this first!
- Create test that:
  1. Instantiates agent with mock LLM provider
  - Use existing Frank LLM provider to replay responses from hard-coded conversations
  2. Uses `InMemoryConversationLogger` to capture exchanges (it doesn't exist yet)
  3. Uses `InMemoryConversationReader` with hard-coded conversation (it doesn't exist yet)
  4. Verifies logged conversation matches expected conversation structure

#### Step 2: In-Memory Conversation Logger <- not yet!
- Create `InMemoryConversationLogger` class that implements same interface as `ConversationLogger`
- Store exchanges in memory list instead of writing to file
- Keep same `log_exchange(prompt, response)` method signature
- Return conversation data when requested instead of file path

#### Step 3: In-Memory Conversation Reader  
- Create `InMemoryConversationReader` class that implements same interface as `ConversationReader`
- Accept a `Conversation` object in constructor instead of file path
- `load_conversation()` method returns the conversation passed to constructor
- Enables testing with pre-defined conversation data

#### Step 4: Test Infrastructure
- Set up test fixtures with sample conversations for Frank to replay
- Add assertion helpers that compare conversation structures with readable error messages

### Instructions

Please implement only Step 1. I want to look at the test before we go any farther. It's OK that the test won't run yet!
I especially want to see whether you create the LLMProvider in a way that I think will work.
