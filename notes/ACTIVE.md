# Active work for Augment Agent right now

We are working on some refactoring.

Frank now accepts a list of exchanges and replays them. If the prompt doesn't match, it is only a warning.
It always returns the next response in the list.

I'm having trouble with types being wrong. The exchanges are currently just whatever we read in from the file.
