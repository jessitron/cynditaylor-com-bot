# Active work for Augment Agent right now

In this file, we will formulate a plan together. Separately, you will implement it.

Our goal is to re-implement how Frank responds so it can read a conversation history
and replay the LLM part in it, failing if the prompt it gets doesn't match the one the conversation expects.

[x] describe a format of conversation history file that will work for that.

Put your format description here:

## Proposed Conversation History Format

I propose a JSON-based format for the conversation history file that Frank can use to replay LLM responses:

```json
{
  "version": "1.0",
  "conversation_id": "unique-conversation-id",
  "timestamp": "2023-06-15T14:30:00Z",
  "exchanges": [
    {
      "id": "exchange-1",
      "prompt": {
        "text": "The exact prompt text sent to the LLM",
        "hash": "sha256-hash-of-prompt-for-verification",
        "metadata": {
          "temperature": 0.7,
          "max_tokens": 1000,
          "other_params": "as_needed"
        }
      },
      "response": {
        "text": "The full response from the LLM to replay",
        "tool_calls": [
          {
            "tool_name": "example_tool",
            "parameters": {"param1": "value1"},
            "result": "Tool execution result"
          }
        ]
      }
    },
    {
      "id": "exchange-2",
      "prompt": {
        "text": "Follow-up prompt including previous context",
        "hash": "sha256-hash-of-prompt-for-verification",
        "metadata": {
          "temperature": 0.7,
          "max_tokens": 1000
        }
      },
      "response": {
        "text": "Follow-up response from the LLM"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

### Key Features:

1. **Prompt Verification**: Each prompt includes a hash that Frank can use to verify if the incoming prompt matches the expected one.

2. **Tool Calls Support**: The format captures any tool calls made during the conversation, including parameters and results.

3. **Metadata**: Includes relevant LLM parameters that might affect the response.

4. **Versioning**: The format includes a version number to allow for future enhancements.

### Implementation Approach:

When Frank receives a prompt:
1. Calculate the hash of the incoming prompt
2. Search the conversation history for a matching prompt hash
3. If found, replay the corresponding response
4. If not found, return an error indicating the prompt doesn't match any in the history

This format allows for accurate replay of complex conversations while ensuring the prompts match exactly what's expected.
