# Active work for Augment Agent right now

We are working on some refactoring.
Note that I have changed some code since you last looked at it.
The LLMProvider is now a Factory Pattern; it supplies a ConversationPartner instead of being one.

We're gonna implement a Decorator Pattern in the ConversationPartner interface.

Right now, Frank has a few responsibilities. It responds to prompts based on a script in a file, and it logs the conversation to a file.

Let's break that into:

[x] LoggingConversationPartner, which accepts a ConversationPartner to do the responding, and logs the conversation to a file as it goes.
[x] add a "finish conversation" method to the ConversationPartner interface, and call it from the agent, so that the logger can save the conversation at the end.
[x] Frank does not log the conversation. It just responds to prompts based on a script in a file.
[x] The LLMProvider returns a LoggingConversationPartner that wraps a Frank.

All tasks completed! The refactoring has been implemented using the Decorator Pattern.
